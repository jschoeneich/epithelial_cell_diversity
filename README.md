# epithelial_cell_diversity

The following code was used to analyse different types of omics-data.

The analysis is separated into different parts:

* Bulk
* Genome Mapping of bulk data using featurecounts
	* Bulk-RNA-Seq analysis using DESeq2
		* Bulk analysis full small intestine only uninfected
		* Bulk analysis full small intestine including infected
		* Bulk analysis crypts vs villi
 		* Bulk analysis of anatomical location (proximal,medial,distal)
* Proteomics analysis using limma
* Single cell analysis using Seurat
	* Costalab single cell pipeline
 	* Single cell subset analyses
 	* Transcription factor analysis using Dorothea
